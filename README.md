# Fiddler

I think you know what happened, by now.

I was watching a video of a [guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q) making this JavaScript fiddle thingy, and I got caught up, and so I ended up using [mare-dom](https://www.github.com/codinghobby/mare-dom) to make something of the sort. You can also check it out in its own [repo](https://www.github.com/codinghobby/fiddler), where it will probably be updated, and on [GitHub pages](https://codinghobby.github.io/fiddler).

It's honestly one of the most awesome things I have ever made, mostly because I made it from scratch, using a library I built myself for frontend.

I hope you find this entertaining! Basically, what this does, is it evaluetes inline JavaScript functions, and it outputs the result of the computations.

You can add and delete segments through a commander, which you can launch by pressing `ctrl+alt+P`, by either clicking on the icons or pressing the relative keyboard shortcuts.

Have fun!
